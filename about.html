                    <h2>What We Specialize In</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="details">
                    <p>We support families and students in gaining acceptance into prestigious international boarding and high schools and colleges in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and beyond.</p>
                    <h3>Admissions Coaching</h3>
                    <p>We partner with families throughout the application process, helping students create unique profiles that resonate with the criteria of admissions officers at top international institutions. Leveraging our experience as educators, school administrators, and admissions coaches, we deeply understand the needs of admissions officers and what differentiates an average applicant who pays higher tuition from a standout applicant whom colleges actively recruit by awarding scholarships and financial aid.</p>
                    <h3>Study Abroad</h3>
                    <p>From selecting the right schools and camps to simplifying the application process, we assist families in making informed decisions when applying to top international institutions. We provide guidance on various testing and visa requirements, and also delve into more nuanced topics such as whether a degree in one country will necessitate further schooling in another, and how to choose a major that will open doors to internships, work, and long-term residency.</p>
                    <h3>Academic Coaching</h3>
                    <p>We mold our students into competitive applicants by identifying the gaps between their abilities and the requirements of their target schools. In addition to connecting students with our network of qualified teachers, we help them to be efficient with their time and strategic with their testing. With shifting standardized testing requirements (test-optional, test-blind), various English examinations (IELTS, TOEFL, DuoLingo), entrance exam options (ACT/SAT), and curriculum options (IB/AP/A-Levels), we help students to define a clear academic path.</p>
                    <h3>Personality Assessment</h3>
                    <p>Our team moderates personality tests and helps students interpret the results. While an online test will measure the results from the test alone, our comprehensive analysis considers a student's personality, education and career goals, grades, passions, and extracurricular interests. Through this holistic process, we find institutions and academic pathways that align with each student's natural preferences and abilities.</p>
                    <h3>Why Choose Kylan Consulting?</h3>
                    <p>Our admissions coaches help students gain acceptance to their target schools every year. From years of experience working with boarding and international schools and colleges on multiple continents, we have consistently simplified complex admissions processes for families while successfully placing students in their target schools.
